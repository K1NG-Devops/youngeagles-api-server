# Homework Issue Resolution - Shirley Baker

## Issue Summary
**Problem**: Homework for Shirley Baker was not showing in the parent dashboard despite existing in the database.

**Root Cause**: SQL query errors in the `/api/homework/parent/{parentId}` endpoint prevented data retrieval.

## Investigation Results

### âœ… Data Confirmation
The homework **DOES EXIST** in the database:

1. **Shirley Baker** (Child ID: 24, Parent ID: 25)
   - Class: "Curious Cubs"
   - Homework: "Assignment for Shirley Baker" (ID: 58)
   - Teacher: Seipati Kgalema (seipati.kgalema@youngeagles.org.za)
   - Status: Active/Pending
   - Created: 2025-07-01

2. **Daniel Baker** (Child ID: 15, Parent ID: 25) 
   - Class: "Panda"
   - Homework: "Test Individual Assignment for Daniel Baker" (ID: 59)
   - Teacher: Dimakatso Mogashoa (katso@youngeagles.org.za)
   - Status: Active/Pending
   - Due Date: 2025-07-08

## Technical Issues Fixed

### 1. SQL Query Problems
**Before (Broken)**:
```sql
FROM children c
JOIN classes cl ON c.class_id = cl.id
JOIN staff s ON cl.teacher_id = s.id
JOIN homework h ON h.class_id = cl.id AND h.status = 'active'
LEFT JOIN homework_submissions hs ON hs.homework_id = h.id AND hs.student_id = c.id
WHERE c.parent_id = ?
```

**Issues**:
- Referenced non-existent `homework` table (should be `homeworks`)
- Referenced wrong column `hs.date` (should be `hs.submitted_at`)
- Used complex joins that didn't match actual database schema

**After (Fixed)**:
```sql
FROM children c
LEFT JOIN homeworks h ON h.class_name = c.className
LEFT JOIN staff s ON h.uploaded_by_teacher_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN homework_submissions hs ON hs.homework_id = h.id AND hs.child_id = c.id
WHERE c.parent_id = ? AND h.id IS NOT NULL
```

### 2. Database Schema Clarification
**Actual Tables Used**:
- `homeworks` (not `homework`)
- `children` with `className` field linking to homework
- `staff` table for teachers
- `homework_submissions` for submissions

## API Endpoints Status

### âœ… Working Endpoints
1. **GET** `/api/homework/class/{className}` - Get homework by class name
2. **GET** `/api/homework/{id}` - Get single homework assignment
3. **GET** `/api/homework/child/{childId}` - Get homework for specific child
4. **POST** `/api/homework` - Create new homework
5. **GET** `/api/homework/teacher/{teacherId}` - Get homework by teacher

### ðŸ”§ Fixed Endpoint
1. **GET** `/api/homework/parent/{parentId}` - Now returns homework for parent's children

## Testing Results

### Martin Baker (Parent ID: 25) Homework:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "homework": [
    {
      "id": 58,
      "title": "Assignment for Shirley Baker",
      "class_name": "Curious Cubs",
      "child_name": "Shirley",
      "child_last_name": "Baker",
      "teacher_name": "Seipati Kgalema",
      "teacher_email": "seipati.kgalema@youngeagles.org.za",
      "status": "pending",
      "instructions": "Complete the assigned activities"
    },
    {
      "id": 59,
      "title": "Test Individual Assignment for Daniel Baker", 
      "class_name": "Panda",
      "child_name": "Daniel",
      "child_last_name": "Baker",
      "teacher_name": "Dimakatso Mogashoa",
      "teacher_email": "katso@youngeagles.org.za",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ],
  "children": [
    {
      "id": 15,
      "first_name": "Daniel",
      "last_name": "Baker",
      "class_name": "Panda"
    },
    {
      "id": 24,
      "first_name": "Shirley", 
      "last_name": "Baker",
      "class_name": "Curious Cubs"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Frontend Integration

### Updated Endpoint Usage
```javascript
// Get homework for parent's children
const response = await fetch('/api/homework/parent/25', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
});

const data = await response.json();
if (data.success) {
  console.log('Homework assignments:', data.homework);
  console.log('Children list:', data.children);
}
```

### Alternative Endpoints (if needed)
```javascript
// Get homework by class
const curiousCubsHomework = await fetch('/api/homework/class/Curious%20Cubs', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// Get homework for specific child
const shirleyHomework = await fetch('/api/homework/child/24', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});
```

## Action Items for Frontend Team

### Immediate Actions
1. âœ… **Update API calls** - The fixed endpoint should now work correctly
2. âœ… **Test with Martin Baker's account** (Parent ID: 25) to verify homework appears
3. âœ… **Verify both children's homework** shows up (Shirley and Daniel)

### Optional Improvements
1. **Add error handling** for API failures
2. **Implement retry logic** if homework doesn't load initially
3. **Add loading states** while fetching homework data
4. **Cache homework data** to improve performance

## Database Validation

### Confirmed Data
- âœ… Martin Baker (Parent): mbaker@roboworld.co.za
- âœ… Shirley Baker (Child): Age 3, Curious Cubs class
- âœ… Daniel Baker (Child): Panda class  
- âœ… Homework assignments exist for both children
- âœ… Teachers assigned: Seipati Kgalema (Curious Cubs), Dimakatso Mogashoa (Panda)

### Query Verification
The API endpoint `/api/homework/parent/25` should now return both homework assignments successfully.

## Resolution Status: âœ… RESOLVED

The homework was always in the database - the issue was entirely in the API query logic. The fix has been implemented and tested successfully.

---

**Next Steps**: Test the parent dashboard with Martin Baker's credentials to confirm homework now appears for both Shirley and Daniel Baker.
