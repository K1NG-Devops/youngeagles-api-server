# 🔄 Server Restart Required

## ⚠️ Important Notice

The attendance routes have been implemented and added to the API, but **the server needs to be restarted** to load the new routes.

## 🚀 How to Restart

1. **Stop the current server** (if running in terminal, press `Ctrl+C`)
2. **Start the server again**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## ✅ Verification

After restarting, you can verify the attendance endpoints are working:

1. **Check the root endpoint** includes attendance:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/ | jq
   ```
   Should show `/api/attendance` in the endpoints list.

2. **Test an attendance endpoint** (requires teacher token):
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/attendance/class \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TEACHER_TOKEN"
   ```

## 📋 What's New

After restart, these endpoints will be available:
- `GET /api/attendance/class/:date?` - Get class attendance
- `POST /api/attendance/mark` - Mark individual attendance  
- `POST /api/attendance/bulk-mark` - Bulk mark attendance
- `GET /api/attendance/history/:startDate/:endDate` - Get history
- `GET /api/attendance/stats/:month?` - Get statistics

The server restart is a one-time requirement after adding the new attendance module.
