# UI Fixes Implemented for Homework Submission System

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Submit Work Button Still Showing in Interactive Activities
**Fixed**: Updated `Homework.jsx` to show different buttons based on homework type:
- **Interactive Homework**: Shows "Start Homework" button (green) 
- **Traditional Homework**: Shows "Submit Work" button (blue)
- **Logic**: Checks for `content_type === 'interactive'` or title keywords like "Basic Addition", "Counting", "Number Recognition"

### 2. ✅ Status Staying as "PENDING" Even After Completion
**Fixed**: Updated status calculation logic in multiple places:
- Updated `getStatusColor()` function to include 'graded' status as submitted
- Updated stats calculation to count both 'submitted' and 'graded' as submitted
- Updated submission details display to show graded homework properly

### 3. ✅ Submission Counter Not Updating
**Fixed**: Enhanced status tracking:
- Modified stats calculation to include `h.status === 'submitted' || h.status === 'graded'`
- Status now properly reflects when homework is auto-submitted from interactive activities

### 4. ✅ Interactive Activity Allows "Try Again" (Multiple Attempts)
**Fixed**: Completely redesigned InteractiveHomework component:
- **Auto-submission**: Interactive homework now automatically submits when completed
- **One-time completion**: Removed "Try Again" button completely
- **Submission tracking**: Added `hasBeenSubmitted` state to prevent duplicate submissions
- **Status display**: Shows submission progress and success confirmation

### 5. ✅ Submit Work Button in Interactive Homework Details
**Fixed**: Updated `EnhancedHomeworkDetail.jsx`:
- Submit Work tab only shows for non-interactive homework
- Interactive homework auto-submits, so manual submission tab is hidden

## Key Changes Made

### InteractiveHomework.jsx
```javascript
// Added auto-submission functionality
const submitInteractiveHomework = async (results) => {
  // Prevents duplicate submissions
  if (hasBeenSubmitted || isSubmitting) return;
  
  // Auto-submits with score and answers
  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('child_id', selectedChildId);
  formData.append('interactive_score', results.percentage);
  formData.append('answers', JSON.stringify(results.answers));
  
  // Calls API to submit homework
  await apiService.homework.submit(homework.id, formData);
};
```

### Homework.jsx Button Logic
```javascript
// Different buttons for different homework types
{(assignment.status === 'pending') && (
  assignment.content_type === 'interactive' || 
  assignment.title.includes('Basic Addition') ? (
    <button>🎮 Start Homework</button>  // Interactive
  ) : (
    <button>📤 Submit Work</button>     // Traditional
  )
)}
```

### Status Calculation Fix
```javascript
// Include both submitted and graded as "submitted"
submitted: homeworkData.filter(h => 
  h.status === 'submitted' || h.status === 'graded'
).length
```

- `homework_submissions.score`: Auto-calculated for interactive
- `homework_submissions.answers_data`: JSON data for interactive responses

## Notifications Integration
